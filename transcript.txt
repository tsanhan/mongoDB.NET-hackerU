1. create an insert record method
2. why the method is generic? 
    we havent defined any type/object or a scheme for the table to look like.
    the generics help us to have some structure(it's optional)
    so the what we saying is that the table it of T type.
    but we havent defined any AddressBook db or any T object scheme table.
    how does mongo do that insert?
    THAT'S the beauty of MongoDB, think of it as a object storage.

3. so let's create an object, a Person.
4. and use the InserRecord to insert the newley object into the newley table in a newley db...
5. run the code...
6. why this works?
     that the InsertOne does is taking that T onject and convert it to JSON.
     behind the seans mongo stores an optimized version of the JSON called Binary JSON (BSON)

7. so there is no structure, not ideal but possible.

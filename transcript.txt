1. lets add Address (with AddressModel) to Person and build a real model to insert

2. and insert it to the tble, this does NOT match the previos two.
3. why this is cool? 
    on any chnage/prop addition you dont need to adjast the schema and create new recods

4. what is the other side of the coin (no normalization)? it's code duplication, why?
    because every record is the authority of data within:
    lat's assume the collation 'Users' is the Users data.
    two married people's record are in this collection.
    they both wil have the same address, right?
    so, if you are a DRY juncky and dont want to deduplicate this...
    look how easy it is to.. say make CRUD oporations on the address of a user... no quering!!!
    
5. so what is the drade here (there is always one!)? it's space for speed.
6. great value for lots of data (like facebook or twetter )

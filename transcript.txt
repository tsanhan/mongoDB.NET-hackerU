1. lets get data
2. Find returns IFindFluent it's like the reference to the query.
3. the toList is the actual command that runs the query
4. implement the usage in the main method

5. what if I dont want toread everying, only one? - implementing LoadRecordById

6. how will I get the Guid to get the record? (going to the Compass and copy the _id will give me the Binary version...)
7. so lets get all the records and breakpoint in the program to see what we got:
8. we can get the goid from one of the records returend
9. why do you think LoadRecordById or LoadRecords methods are generic?

10. continuing next to Update and Delete...

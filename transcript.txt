1. build an Upsert  method: like PUT (insert or update).
    the idea is resemling a merge

2. build a Delete method

3. lets use these methods, but before that lets add a property to our model.
    two things I want to do with this:
        1. i want to use the correct values when inserting this data (utc - universal time code, not local)
        2. the second thig is that I want to change the name from DateOfBirth to dob 
            for 2: we'll use a BsonElement decorator;
            for 1: we'll create the correct datetime add add it
4. after viewing in the db the result we can conclude that we updated the record;

5. lets delete the record
    comment the Upsert and use the delete method 

6. so far I have tweaked the PersonModel a bit but not too much.
lets create a new model to use ( for the same data... whaaaaaat?!?!?)

1. lets change something: addd GUID to the Model;
2. [BsonId] will be mongo's Id for this table so InsertOne will:
    - store as _id, don't warry about 'Id' => '_id' naming mepping
    - create one if no Id was provided
    why is it a nice functionality?
    we can check if Id exsist to determine if it's an update or create operation

3. if we run the code we'll see the Person created.
4. so terminoligy wise: table => collection, record/row => document
